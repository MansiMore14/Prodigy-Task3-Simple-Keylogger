# Prodigy-Task3-Simple-Keylogger
Overview

The Simple Keylogger program is designed to track and record keystrokes in real-time. Each keystroke is logged with a corresponding timestamp, and the captured data is stored in a file for later review. This project showcases the technical proficiency needed for keystroke logging, but more importantly, it stresses the importance of ethical considerations surrounding the use of such tools.

Features

Keystroke Logging: Tracks every keystroke, including special characters, and logs them alongside a timestamp for precise recording.
File Logging: Saves all captured keystrokes to a file, allowing for structured and easy retrieval of data.
Timestamps: Each keystroke entry is appended with the exact time of the event, making the log highly detailed.
Cross-Platform Compatibility: Designed to work seamlessly on Windows, macOS, and Linux, ensuring broad applicability.
Ethical Emphasis: The project emphasizes strict adherence to ethical standards and legal compliance, ensuring that keylogging is used responsibly.

Requirements

Python 3.x: The program is developed using Python, a versatile programming language.

Pynput Library: This library enables the program to monitor and control input devices like the keyboard in real-time.

Ethical Considerations

Keylogging, while a powerful tool, poses significant ethical and privacy concerns. It is crucial to ensure that this tool is only used with explicit consent from the affected parties. Developers and users must abide by legal frameworks and ethical guidelines to respect privacy and avoid unauthorized surveillance.
